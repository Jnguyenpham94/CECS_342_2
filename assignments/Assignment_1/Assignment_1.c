// Assignment_1.cpp : This file contains the 'main' function. Program execution begins and ends there.
//The implementation of merge sort in C will require a temporary array. This array has to be
/*
* allocated on the heap(and not the stack).Make sure to do this correctly and try to
understand why this is necessary.
4. Write a simple main function(one in C and one in Haskell) with a few test cases.Make sure
to cover edge cases like empty or invalid input.
